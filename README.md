# PPSC_task_4: Tracking the Robot
**| difficulty: 7/10 |**

You are in charge of a NASA mars robot, and they spent 2 billion dollars on it. Suddently, you lost connection and direct control with it. You were tasked to return it back to the Mars base by the end of the week, or else you'll lose your job. Terrified, you retrieve the recordings of the rover's movement and orientation. Using this, your team successfully dragged the robot back to the base to repair its satellite.

This robot started by facing in the x+ direction. 
__________________________________________________________________________________
**Input**:
You are given a list, the first item being the starting coordinates of the robot, seperated by a space (ex: "x x"). Then, you have a list of instructions that the robot processed. "forward x" being going forward in the direction the robot is facing. "right x" and "left x" (x in increments of 90) turning by the degree. 
__________________________________________________________________________________
**Output**:
You are to return the final coordinates of the robot, seperated by a space. "x x\n". Remember to add in the last newline. This is needed to match the format for the task result.

**optional challenge: write you code in under 20 lines**

This problem deals with lists, finding values using the indexes of a list, casting datatypes, for loops, and if statements. This task will help you get comfortable with using lists.

For additional help, either ask Paul, Joshua, Mr. Blattner, or any other staff member for assistance. If multiple people have the same obstacles, we would be able to go over them during the club. 

Otherwise, you can use https://tutorialdeep.com/knowhow/get-list-element-by-index-python/ for getting items in a list using indexes, https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_for_loops.asp for for loops, and https://www.w3schools.com/python/gloss_python_if_statement.asp for if statements.
